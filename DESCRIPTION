Description: Provides functions for converting gene symbols to IDs and vice versa,
    with support for historical gene names (synonyms). Includes pre-built databases
    for human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), and rat (Rattus norvegicus)
    from NCBI Gene. Supports both NCBI symbols and official nomenclature authority
    symbols (HGNC/MGI/RGD), ensuring proper handling of mitochondrial genes.
    Provides detailed conversion summary statistics and logging functionality.
    Includes ortholog mapping for cross-species gene conversion between human,
    mouse, and rat based on NCBI gene_orthologs database.
